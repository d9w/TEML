Evolutionary computation (EC) has long been at the forefront of harnessing the principles of natural selection to solve complex problems in a myriad of domains, ranging from optimization to artificial intelligence. Recently, the fusion of EC with machine learning (ML) techniques has opened new vistas for research, offering unprecedented opportunities to tackle some of the most challenging issues faced by the scientific community today. This intersectional domain leverages the explorative power of evolutionary algorithms to enhance the adaptability and efficiency of machine learning models, leading to breakthroughs in algorithmic design, problem-solving methodologies, and the interpretability of artificial intelligence systems.

The Toulouse Workshop on Evolutionary Computation and Machine Learning will explore the interactions between EC and ML. This workshop will spotlight a diverse array of topics, including but not limited to the evolutionary design of explainable algorithms for biomedical image segmentation, the deployment of graph genetic programming for interpretable control, advancements in active learning, and the quest for quality and diversity in reinforcement learning. With an international panel of speakers converging in Toulouse, this event will be a platform for showcasing how evolutionary principles can drive the creation of diverse forms of artificial intelligence.
