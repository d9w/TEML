Evolutionary computation (EC) has long been at the forefront of harnessing the principles of natural selection to solve complex problems in a myriad of domains, ranging from optimization to artificial intelligence. Recently, the fusion of EC with machine learning (ML) techniques has opened new vistas for research, offering unprecedented opportunities to tackle some of the most challenging issues faced by the scientific community today. This intersectional domain leverages the explorative power of evolutionary algorithms to enhance the adaptability and efficiency of machine learning models, leading to breakthroughs in algorithmic design, problem-solving methodologies, and the interpretability of artificial intelligence systems.

The Toulouse Workshop on Evolutionary Computation and Machine Learning will explore the interactions between EC and ML. This workshop will spotlight a diverse array of topics, including but not limited to the evolutionary design of explainable algorithms for biomedical image segmentation, the deployment of graph genetic programming for interpretable control, advancements in active learning, and the quest for quality and diversity in reinforcement learning. With an international panel of speakers converging in Toulouse, this event will be a platform for showcasing how evolutionary principles can drive the creation of diverse forms of artificial intelligence.

### Abstract:

While training an artificial agent for complex tasks like driving a car, mastering a video game, or controlling plasma in a nuclear fusion reactor, innovations can lead to intelligent behavior. In such scenarios, a promising approach is to mimick the natural world's evolutionary process, which has honed the problem-solving capabilities of animal brains. Evolutionary Neural Policy Search (ENPS) draws inspiration from this concept. It creates a diverse population of "brains" represented by neural networks, allowing the system to "evolve" by selectively combining and mutating successful individuals. This thesis delves into the core components of ENPS and their intricate interplay. By analyzing the structures of ENPS, the goal is to design novel policy search methods that enhance these components, ultimately leading to the development of more efficient and effective learning algorithms for complex tasks.
